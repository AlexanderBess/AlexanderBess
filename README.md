# 👋 Hi, I'm Alexander Bessmelcev

### 🧑‍💻 Frontend Developer — Vue.js Enthusiast | Interface Crafter | Code Quality Advocate

I'm a frontend developer with **5+ years of experience** building sleek, performant, and user-focused interfaces. My main toolkit revolves around **Vue.js**, **JavaScript**, and **TypeScript** — from legacy code refactoring to designing modern architecture and delivering real-time applications.

I’ve worked remotely on projects ranging from **P2P platforms** to **B2B dashboards**, and even built **Web3 interfaces**. Whether I'm building components from scratch or migrating full apps from Vue 2 to Vue 3, I care deeply about clean code, great UX, and fast iteration alongside product teams.
